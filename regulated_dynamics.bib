We consider methods based on collective variable biasing and on tempering, and offer both historical and contemporary perspectives. In collective-variable biasing, we first discuss methods stemming from thermodynamic integration that use mean force biasing, including the adaptive biasing force algorithm and temperature acceleration. We then turn to methods that use bias potentials, including umbrella sampling and metadynamics. We next consider parallel tempering and replica-exchange methods. We conclude with a brief presentation of some combination methods.},

  abstract = {In order to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations using polarizable force fields, we combine a new extended Lagrangian approach that eliminates the self-consistent field step (iEL/0-SCF) with a stochastic integration scheme that allows for a long time step using a multiple time scale algorithm (SIN(R)). We consider different algorithms for the combined scheme that places different components of the nonbonded forces into different time scales, as well as splitting individual nonbonded forces across time scales, to demonstrate that the combined method works well for bulk water as well as for a concentrated salt solution, aqueous peptide, and solvated protein. Depending on system and desired accuracy, the iEL/0-SCF and SIN(R) combination yields lower bound computational speed-ups of {$\sim$}6-8 relative to a molecular dynamics Verlet integration using a standard SCF solver implemented in the reference program TINKER 8.1. The combined approach embodies a significant advance for equilibrium simulations in the canonical ensemble of many-body potential energy surfaces for condensed phase systems with speed-ups that exceed what is possible by either method alone.},

  abstract = {Metadynamics is an established sampling method aimed at reconstructing the free-energy surface relative to a set of appropriately chosen collective variables. In standard metadynamics, the free-energy surface is filled by the addition of Gaussian potentials of preassigned and typically diagonal covariance. Asymptotically the free-energy surface is proportional to the bias deposited. Here, we consider the possibility of using Gaussians whose variance is adjusted on the fly to the local properties of the free-energy surface. We suggest two different prescriptions: one is based on the local diffusivity and the other on the local geometrical properties. We further examine the problem of extracting the free-energy surface when using adaptive Gaussians. We show that the standard relation between the bias and the free energy does not hold. In the limit of narrow Gaussians an explicit correction can be evaluated. In the general case, we propose to use instead a relation between bias and free energy borrowed from umbrella sampling. This relation holds for all kinds of incrementally deposited bias. We illustrate on the case of alanine dipeptide the advantage of using adaptive Gaussians in conjunction with the new free-energy estimator both in terms of accuracy and speed of convergence.},

To broaden the scope of eABF and its variants, like its generalized form (egABF), and make them available to other MD engines, e.g., GROMACS, AMBER, CP2K, and openMM, we present a PLUMED-based implementation, called extended-Lagrangian free energy calculation (ELF). This implementation can be used as a stand-alone gradient estimator for other CV-based sampling algorithms, such as temperature-accelerated MD (TAMD) and extendedLagrangian metadynamics (MtD). ELF provides the end user with a convenient framework to help select the best-suited importance-sampling algorithm for a given application without any commitment to a particular MD engine.},

  abstract = {In the host of numerical schemes devised to calculate free energy differences by way of geometric transformations, the adaptive biasing force algorithm has emerged as a promising route to map complex free-energy landscapes. It relies upon the simple concept that as a simulation progresses, a continuously updated biasing force is added to the equations of motion, such that in the long-time limit it yields a Hamiltonian devoid of an average force acting along the transition coordinate of interest. This means that sampling proceeds uniformly on a flat free-energy surface, thus providing reliable free-energy estimates. Much of the appeal of the algorithm to the practitioner is in its physically intuitive underlying ideas and the absence of any requirements for prior knowledge about free-energy landscapes. Since its inception in 2001, the adaptive biasing force scheme has been the subject of considerable attention, from in-depth mathematical analysis of convergence properties to novel developments and extensions. The method has also been successfully applied to many challenging problems in chemistry and biology. In this contribution, the method is presented in a comprehensive, self-contained fashion, discussing with a critical eye its properties, applicability, and inherent limitations, as well as introducing novel extensions. Through free-energy calculations of prototypical molecular systems, many methodological aspects are examined, from stratification strategies to overcoming the so-called hidden barriers in orthogonal space, relevant not only to the adaptive biasing force algorithm but also to other importance-sampling schemes. On the basis of the discussions in this paper, a number of good practices for improving the efficiency and reliability of the computed free-energy differences are proposed.},

Here, we start from the realization that four enhanced sampling methods, metadynamics and well-tempered metadynamics (in their extended Lagrangian form), as well as driven adiabatic free energy dynamics (dAFED) and unified free energy dynamics (UFED), can be used in combination with any of the three above-mentioned FES estimators. We compare the convergence properties of these estimators on the alanine dipeptide and a sodium ion solvation shell. We find that the mean force estimator is superior in all cases. We also show that it can be marginally beneficial to combine information from the histogram and the force, provided that both are of comparable accuracy.},

  abstract = {We reformulate the algorithm of Gr\{\textbackslash{}o\}nbech-Jensen and Farago (GJF) for Langevin dynamics simulations at constant temperature. The GJF algorithm has become increasingly popular in molecular dynamics simulations because it provides robust (i.e., insensitive to variations in the time step) and accurate configurational sampling of the phase space with larger time steps than other Langevin thermostats. In the original derivation [Mol. Phys. \{\textbackslash{}bf 111\}, 983 (2013)], the algorithm was formulated as a velocity-Verlet type integrator with an in-site velocity variable. Here, we reformulate it as a leap frog scheme with a half-step velocity variable. In contrast to the original form, the reforumlated one also provides robust and accurate estimations of kinetic measures such as the average kinetic energy. We analytically prove that the newly presented algorithm gives the exact configurational and kinetic temperatures of a harmonic oscillator for any time step smaller than the Verlet stability limit, and use computer simulations to demonstrate the configurational and kinetic robustness of the algorithm in strongly non-linear systems. This property of the new formulation of the GJF thermostat makes it very attractive for implementation in computer simulations.},

  abstract = {For a wide range of phenomena, current computational ability does not always allow for fully atomistic simulations of high-dimensional molecular systems to reach time scales of interest. Coarse-graining (CG) is an established approach to alleviate the impact of computational limits while retaining the same algorithms used in atomistic simulations. It is of importance to understand how algorithms such as Langevin integrators perform on nontrivial CG molecular systems, and in particular how large of an integration time step can be used without introducing unacceptable amounts of error into averaged quantities of interest. To investigate this, we examined three different Langevin integrators on a CG polymer melt: the recently developed BAOAB method by Leimkuhler and Matthews [17], the Gr{\o}nbechJensen and Farago method [12], or G\textendash{}JF, and the frequently used Bru\textasciidieresis{}nger-Brooks-Karplus integrator [6], also known as BBK. We compute and analyze key statistical properties for each. Our results indicate that the three integrators perform similarly when using a small friction parameter; however, outside of this regime the use of large integration steps produces significant deviations from the predicted diffusivity and steady-state distributions for all integration methods examined with the exception of G\textendash{}JF.},

  abstract = {Considered are numerical integration schemes for nondissipative dynamical systems in which multiple time scales are present. It is assumed that one can do an explicit separation of the RHS ``forces'' into fast forces and slow forces such that (i) the fast forces contain the high frequency part of the solution, (ii) the fast forces are conservative, and (iii) the reduced problem consisting only of the fast forces can be integrated much more cheaply than the full problem. The fast forces are allowed to have low frequency components. Particular applications for which the schemes are intended include N-body problems (for which most of the forces are slow) and nonlinear wave phenomena (for which the fast forces can be propagated by spectral methods). The assumption of cheap integration of fast forces implies that the overall cost of integration is primarily determined by the step size used to sample the slow forces. A long-time-step method is one in which this step size exceeds half the period of the fastest normal mode present in the full system. An existing method that comes close to qualifying is the ``impulse'' method, also known as Verlet-I and r-RESPA. It is shown that it might fail, though, for a couple of reasons. First, it suffers a serious loss of accuracy if the step size is near a multiple of the period of a normal mode, and, second, it is unstable if the step size is near a multiple of half the period of a normal mode. Proposed in this paper is a ``mollified'' impulse method having an error bound that is independent of the frequency of the fast forces. It is also shown to possess superior stability properties. Theoretical results are supplemented by numerical experiments. The method is efficient and reasonably easy to implement.},

The algorithm introduces distance classes to schedule updates of non-bonding interactions and to avoid unnecessary computations of interactions between particles which are far apart. To minimize the error caused by the updating schedule, the Verlet integration scheme has been modified. The results of the method are compared to those of other approximation schemesas well as to results obtained by numerical integration without approximation. For simulation of a protein with 12 637 atoms our approximation scheme yields a reduction of computer time by a factor of seven. The approximation suggested can be implemented on sequential as well as on parallel computers. We describe an implementation on a (Transputer-based) MIMD machine with a systolic ring architecture.},

The GJF method has been demonstrated to give robust and accurate configurational sampling of the phase space, and its applications to, e.g. Molecular Dynamics is well established. A new definition of the discrete-time velocity variable is proposed based on analytical calculations of the kinetic response of a harmonic oscillator subjected to friction and noise. The new companion velocity to the GJF method is demonstrated to yield exact and time-step-independent kinetic responses for, e.g. kinetic energy, its fluctuations, and Green-Kubo diffusion based on velocity autocorrelations. This observation allows for a new and convenient Leap-Frog algorithm, which efficiently and exactly represents statistical measures of both kinetic and configurational properties at any time step within the stability limit for systems in linear and harmonic potentials. We outline the simplicity of the algorithm and demonstrate its attractive time-step-independent features for nonlinear and complex systems through applications to a one-dimensional nonlinear oscillator and three-dimensional Molecular Dynamics.},

  abstract = {We report a theoretical description and numerical tests of the extended-system adaptive biasing force method (eABF), together with an unbiased estimator of the free energy surface from eABF dynamics. Whereas the original ABF approach uses its running estimate of the free energy gradient as the adaptive biasing force, eABF is built on the idea that the exact free energy gradient is not necessary for efficient exploration, and that it is still possible to recover the exact free energy separately with an appropriate estimator. eABF does not directly bias the collective coordinates of interest, but rather fictitious variables that are harmonically coupled to them; therefore is does not require second derivative estimates, making it easily applicable to a wider range of problems than ABF. Furthermore, the extended variables present a smoother, coarse-grain-like sampling problem on a mollified free energy surface, leading to faster exploration and convergence. We also introduce CZAR, a simple, unbiased free energy estimator from eABF trajectories. eABF/CZAR converges to the physical free energy surface faster than standard ABF for a wide range of parameters.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics has been used for decades to generate data from which thermodynamic properties as defined by statistical mechanics can be computed. Though very powerful, molecular dynamics contains at least two key inefficiencies: (1) It is common to compute all forces present in a system during every step forward in time, though many forces are slow to evolve and to repeatedly compute them only serves as vigorous CPU exercise. (2) Rare events such as the transition from one state in a free energy minimum to another state in another free energy minimum are as rare in simulations as they are in reality. Thus, simulations which are already inefficient due to (1) require long simulation times for interesting properties to be calculated accurately. In this dissertation, both of these issues are addressed with novel simulation algorithms and methods, and real systems such as liquid water, a small polypeptide in solvent, and a peptide antigen/cell surface protein complex in solvent are probed. It is shown that computation time for molecular dynamics can be decreased by over an order of magnitude with the SIN(R) molecular dynamics integrator, while preserving physical properties of the system of interest, and that the path-dAFED and path-UFED enhanced sampling algorithms can recover accurate free energy differences of states with minimal pre- and post-processing of data.},

  abstract = {Kinetic energy equipartition is a premise for many deterministic and stochastic molecular dynamics methods that aim at sampling a canonical ensemble. While this is expected for real systems, discretization errors introduced by the numerical integration may lead to deviations from equipartition. Fortunately, backward error analysis allows us to obtain a higher-order estimate of the quantity that is actually subject to equipartition. This is related to a shadow Hamiltonian, which converges to the specified Hamiltonian only when the time-step size approaches zero. This paper deals with discretization effects in a straightforward way. With a small computational overhead, we obtain refined versions of the kinetic and potential energies, whose sum is a suitable estimator of the shadow Hamiltonian. Then, we tune the thermostatting procedure by employing the refined kinetic energy instead of the conventional one. This procedure is shown to reproduce a canonical ensemble compatible with the refined system, as opposed to the original one, but canonical averages regarding the latter can easily be recovered by reweighting. Water, modeled as a rigid body, is an excellent test case for our proposal because its numerical stability extends up to time steps large enough to yield pronounced discretization errors in Verlet-type integrators. By applying our new approach, we were able to mitigate discretization effects in equilibrium properties of liquid water for time-step sizes up to 5 fs.},

We first prove the exponential convergence of the law of the continuous process to the Boltzmann\textendash{}Gibbs measure by a hypocoercive approach and characterize the asymptotic variance of empirical averages over trajectories. We next develop numerical schemes which are stable and of weak order two by considering splitting strategies where the discretizations of the fluctuation/dissipation are corrected by a Metropolis procedure. We use the newly developed schemes for two applications: optimizing the shape of the kinetic energy for the so-called adaptively restrained Langevin dynamics (which considers perturbations of standard quadratic kinetic energies vanishing around the origin) and reducing the metastability of some toy models using nonglobally Lipschitz kinetic energies.},

  abstract = {Complex systems that bridge the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science can be studied at an unprecedented level of detail using increasingly sophisticated theoretical methodology and high-speed computers. The aim of this book is to prepare burgeoning users and developers to become active participants in this exciting and rapidly advancing research area by uniting for the first time, in one monograph, the basic concepts of equilibrium and time-dependent statistical mechanics with the modern techniques used to solve the complex problems that arise in real-world applications. The book contains a detailed review of classical and quantum mechanics, in-depth discussions of the most commonly used simultaneously with modern computational techniques such as molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo, and important topics including free-energy calculations, linear-response theory, harmonic baths and the generalized Langevin equation, critical phenomena, and advanced conformational sampling methods. Burgeoning users and developers are thus provided firm grounding to become active participants in this exciting and rapidly advancing research area, while experienced practitioners will find the book to be a useful reference tool for the field.To request a copy of the Solutions Manual, visit: http://global.oup.com/uk/academic/physics/admin/solutions},

In this paper, we extend the ``middle'' scheme to molecular dynamics algorithms for configurational sampling in systems subject to constraints. Holonomic constraints and isokinetic constraints are used for demonstration. Numerical examples indicate that the ``middle'' scheme presents a promising approach to calculate configuration-dependent thermodynamic properties and their thermal fluctuations.},
